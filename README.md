# sql
This is a template for make a php mssql connection

Config/conexion.php configure your mssql bbdd conexion.

index.php is the view, a form where select what you want to find and see in table below query results.

src/classes/consulta.php is controller where queries are made.

Also you can find a sqlexport.txt which you can use like a template in you mssql datamodel.

I hope it will help you.
